"""Unified halt event — the fresh struct behind the Kaizen voice (Sprint A).

GRV-010 C2a gave us :class:`grove.governance_halt.GovernanceHaltContext`, but
that struct is **C2a-terminal-coupled**: every instance terminalizes a turn
(``terminal_halt_result`` assumes the turn ended). Widening it to carry a
recoverable, non-terminal halt would bleed terminal semantics into the
collaborative path (the Q1 risk).

:class:`HaltEvent` is therefore a FRESH struct, not a generalization.
``GovernanceHaltContext`` maps INTO it via the single boundary adapter
:func:`halt_event_from_governance_context` — the one place where terminal
semantics attach to context-sourced halts (``severity = TERMINAL``, pinned at
the boundary). The two RAW build-time surfaces (the dispatcher's
non-interactive deny observations and the red-zone privilege surface)
construct ``HaltEvent`` directly at their sites with their own structural
facts.

Feed-worthiness is **renderer-derived**, never carried on the struct: there is
deliberately NO ``feed_criterion`` field. Producers report structural facts
only (severity + capability flags + zone); the renderer is the sole
Feed-Commit Enforcement Point that decides feed vs. Orchestration Bus
telemetry. See :func:`is_feed_worthy`.

This shape is the contract Sprint 77.3 binds to — the field names are pinned.
